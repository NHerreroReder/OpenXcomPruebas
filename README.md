OpenXcom is an open-source clone of the popular "UFO: Enemy Unknown" ("X-COM:
UFO Defense" in the USA release) and "X-COM: Terror From the Deep" videogames
by Microprose, licensed under the GPL and written in C++ / SDL.

and the [wiki](https://www.ufopaedia.org/index.php/OpenXcom).

## MAP2 support

This forked version of OXCE introduces support for a new format for map files,
called MAP2. MAP2 format stores map info using uint16 (2 bytes) data instead of char (8 bits). 
This way the max. quantity of different tiles used to build a MAP is upped to 65535.
- In case of map files with the same name and different format, MAP files will have
precedence over MAP2; so, in order to use a MAP2 version, make sure that MAP versions
of the block are removed at all folders explored by the application (user/mod/<modname>/MAPS, 
standard/xcom1/MAPS,  standard/xcom2/MAPS and UFO/MAPS).
- Terrain definitions can include now more MCD files, in order to have more than 253 different tiles. 
Just add more MCD files names at the terrain ruleset definition.
- MAP/MAP2 files can be mixed in a terrain ruleset, but if a MAP file uses a tile with index > 255 it
will be displayed incorrectly. So it's better to load first MCD files with info for MAP files and then
the extra tiles for MAP2 blocks.

In order to generate a MAP2 version from a MAP file or create a new MAP/MAP2 file a
modified versión of battlescape-editor (by Ohartenstein23) can be used. This version can be
found at https://github.com/FlaubertNHR/OpenXcomPruebas/tree/battlescape-editor_MAP-MAP2.
The modified battlescape-editor includes a button to batch-generate MAP2 versions for
all the MAP files used at a loaded MOD. These MAP2 files will be placed in the /user/[mod]/
folder, so they should be copied to MOD's /MAP folder, and equivalent MAP files should be manually
removed to allow OXCE to load MAP2 files instead of MAP ones.

Furthermore a modified version of MapView2 (by KevL) can be obtained from here: https://github.com/FlaubertNHR/OpenXCOM.ToolsMAP2 This version can load, edit and create map files in both MAP and MAP2 format.

For convenience, windows binaries (32 and 64 bits) have been added to folder 'WindowsBinaries'. These EXEs have been tested to work in a Windows11 machine (64 bits).

You can just place one of these EXEs in the same folder than the original openxcom.exe and just click it when you want start the game with MAP2 format support.

## Installation

OpenXcom requires a vanilla copy of the X-COM resources -- from either or both
of the original games.  If you own the games on Steam, the Windows installer
will automatically detect it and copy the resources over for you.

If you want to copy things over manually, you can find the Steam game folders
at:

    UFO: "Steam\SteamApps\common\XCom UFO Defense\XCOM"
    TFTD: "Steam\SteamApps\common\X-COM Terror from the Deep\TFD"

Do not use modded versions (e.g. with XcomUtil) as they may cause bugs and
crashes.  Copy the UFO subfolders to the UFO subdirectory in OpenXcom's data
or user folder and/or the TFTD subfolders to the TFTD subdirectory in OpenXcom's
data or user folder (see below for folder locations).

## Mods

Mods are an important and exciting part of the game.  OpenXcom comes with a set
of standard mods based on traditional XcomUtil and UFOExtender functionality.
There is also a [mod portal website](https://openxcom.mod.io/) with a thriving
mod community with hundreds of innovative mods to choose from.

To install a mod, go to the mods subdirectory in your user directory (see below
for folder locations).  Extract the mod into a new subdirectory.  WinZip has an
"Extract to" option that creates a directory whose name is based on the archive
name.  It doesn't really matter what the directory name is as long as it is
unique.  Some mods are packed with extra directories at the top, so you may
need to move files around inside the new mod directory to get things straighted
out.  For example, if you extract a mod to mods/LulzMod and you see something
like:

    mods/LulzMod/data/TERRAIN/
    mods/LulzMod/data/Rulesets/

and so on, just move everything up a level so it looks like:

    mods/LulzMod/TERRAIN/
    mods/LulzMod/Rulesets/

and you're good to go!  Enable your new mod on the Options -> Mods page in-game.

## Directory Locations

OpenXcom has three directory locations that it searches for user and game files:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Folder Type</th>
    <th>Folder Contents</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>user</td>
    <td>mods, savegames, screenshots</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>config</td>
    <td>game configuration</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>data</td>
    <td>UFO and TFTD data files, standard mods, common resources</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Each of these default to different paths on different operating systems (shown
below).  For the user and config directories, OpenXcom will search a list of
directories and use the first one that already exists.  If none exist, it will
create a directory and use that.  When searching for files in the data
directory, OpenXcom will search through all of the named directories, so some
files can be installed in one directory and others in another.  This gives
you some flexibility in case you can't copy UFO or TFTD resource files to some
system locations.  You can also specify your own path for each of these by
passing a commandline argument when running OpenXcom.  For example:

    openxcom -data "$HOME/bin/OpenXcom/usr/share/openxcom"

or, if you have a fully self-contained installation:

    openxcom -data "$HOME/games/openxcom/data" -user "$HOME/games/openxcom/user" -config "$HOME/games/openxcom/config"
