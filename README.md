## Battlescape Editor
 Map Editor for Open X-Com Extended (OXCE) is intended for demonstration and testing of the basic functionality of an in-game map editor. Feedback on the user interface and functionality are appreciated as are bug reports, but bug fixing support will likely be slow and tied to new feature releases. Please read through the following list of included and planned features before making suggestions for further development. It is also not intended to replace MapView but rather to provide supplementary map editing with minimal setup outside installation of OXCE. The primary features in this release are

- Editing of maps included in the currently loaded set of mods
- Creating new maps from the terrains defined in the currently loaded set of mods
- Editing single tiles at a time by adding, changing, or removing objects within the tile
- Editing single AI nodes at a time by adding, moving, changing, and removing them and their links
- Switching between tile and AI node editing modes
- Undoing and redoing single tile/node edits
- Saving edited .MAP and .RMP files in the current OXCE user folder
- Sample ruleset for implementation of the edited .MAP and .RMP files in the openxcom.log file
- Opening the main Map Editor Menu for creating/selecting a new map to edit directly from the Editor Interface.
- Editing multiple tiles/nodes at a time by both rectangular selection and paintbrush-style selection tools
- Copying, cutting, and pasting selections of multiple tiles/nodes at once
- Find and replace tools for searching and editing tile and node content
- Searching of text lists in the Map Editor Menu
- Find and replace tools for searching and editing tile and node content

The following features are planned for future releases:

- Option to attempt to match MCDs across maps when pasting tiles
- Creating new maps with custom terrains from a selection of terrain data sets (.MCD files) from the currently loaded set of mods
- Direct loading of .MAP files from a specified directory using a supplementary file to indicate which terrain data sets to use
- Resizing maps
- Improved Map Editor main menu
- Testing map being edited in the battlescape before saving and importing changes due to tile destruction

## Installation

OpenXcom requires a vanilla copy of the X-COM resources -- from either or both
of the original games.  If you own the games on Steam, the Windows installer
will automatically detect it and copy the resources over for you.

If you want to copy things over manually, you can find the Steam game folders
at:

    UFO: "Steam\SteamApps\common\XCom UFO Defense\XCOM"
    TFTD: "Steam\SteamApps\common\X-COM Terror from the Deep\TFD"

Do not use modded versions (e.g. with XcomUtil) as they may cause bugs and
crashes.  Copy the UFO subfolders to the UFO subdirectory in OpenXcom's data
or user folder and/or the TFTD subfolders to the TFTD subdirectory in OpenXcom's
data or user folder (see below for folder locations).

## Mods

Mods are an important and exciting part of the game.  OpenXcom comes with a set
of standard mods based on traditional XcomUtil and UFOExtender functionality.
There is also a [mod portal website](https://openxcom.mod.io/) with a thriving
mod community with hundreds of innovative mods to choose from.

To install a mod, go to the mods subdirectory in your user directory (see below
for folder locations).  Extract the mod into a new subdirectory.  WinZip has an
"Extract to" option that creates a directory whose name is based on the archive
name.  It doesn't really matter what the directory name is as long as it is
unique.  Some mods are packed with extra directories at the top, so you may
need to move files around inside the new mod directory to get things straighted
out.  For example, if you extract a mod to mods/LulzMod and you see something
like:

    mods/LulzMod/data/TERRAIN/
    mods/LulzMod/data/Rulesets/

and so on, just move everything up a level so it looks like:

    mods/LulzMod/TERRAIN/
    mods/LulzMod/Rulesets/

and you're good to go!  Enable your new mod on the Options -> Mods page in-game.

## Directory Locations

OpenXcom has three directory locations that it searches for user and game files:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Folder Type</th>
    <th>Folder Contents</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>user</td>
    <td>mods, savegames, screenshots</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>config</td>
    <td>game configuration</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>data</td>
    <td>UFO and TFTD data files, standard mods, common resources</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Each of these default to different paths on different operating systems (shown
below).  For the user and config directories, OpenXcom will search a list of
directories and use the first one that already exists.  If none exist, it will
create a directory and use that.  When searching for files in the data
directory, OpenXcom will search through all of the named directories, so some
files can be installed in one directory and others in another.  This gives
you some flexibility in case you can't copy UFO or TFTD resource files to some
system locations.  You can also specify your own path for each of these by
passing a commandline argument when running OpenXcom.  For example:

    openxcom -data "$HOME/bin/OpenXcom/usr/share/openxcom"

or, if you have a fully self-contained installation:

    openxcom -data "$HOME/games/openxcom/data" -user "$HOME/games/openxcom/user" -config "$HOME/games/openxcom/config"
